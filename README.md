# kalman_python
Independent Study Kalman Filter Implementation

This program runs a 2-dimenional kalman filter for tracking of the position and velocity of an object with sliders 
to control the input of the the kalman matrix. This is meant to be a interactive gui for visual aid in understanding
the kalman filter.
